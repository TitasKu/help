# "Sources" Explained

At the core of the Intempt Platform is the concept of Sources. Sources are real-time data extraction “plugins” created for you and run lean and scalable. Sources serve as a medium for getting valuable User behavior data. They can be used to power all sorts of actions that increase user acquisition, conversion, retention, and drive growth in your business.

## SOURCES ARE AUTOTRACKED

At first glance, Sources may seem like an expensive way to integrate data from cumbersome back-ends.  However, Intempt has innovated on traditional data collection scripts by using AutoTrack as a basis to gather data. You simply add the Source API code to your Website or Mobile App, and all user data is automatically collected on your behalf.

You can currently Autotrack Web and iOS applications on the Intempt Platform. You can import data from any Server that can interact with a REST endpoint found documented on our [Developer Portal](http://dev.intempt.com "Developer Portal").
