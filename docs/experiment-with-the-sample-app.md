# Experiment with the Sample App

## 1. Web App

You will first need to register for a free account on [Intempt Platform](https://app.intempt.com/login "Intempt Platform").

For the Web App, you’ll need to create your own authorization token and to add that to the sample app. This is the most straight-forward ⁠— sign-up and Create a New Organization. You will then Create a New Source of type Web.

You should then fork our [Github repo](https://github.com/intempt/intempt-js/tree/develop/intemptwebapp "intemptwebapp") and replace the Playground Source referenced within the Sample App to your own.
