# Sample App

We have built and released a sample app to showcase what's possible with Intempt Platform API’s and SDK’s. The sample app is available on both Web and iOS and is built using native Intempt SDKs and 3rd party libraries. The App is open-sourced and is included with the Intempt Web and iOS SDK’s sourced on Github.

- Web - [Intempt SDK App](https://github.com/intempt/intempt-js/tree/develop/intemptwebapp).
- iOS - [Intempt SDK App](https://github.com/intempt/intempt-sdk-ios/tree/develop/demo-app).

## Motivations for building the Sample App

1. Showcase what's possible with Intempt Platform.
2. Make it simple for anyone to experience CDP and Personalization technology.
3. Make it simple for developers to understand the CDP and Personalization features and how they can be incorporated into their own apps.
