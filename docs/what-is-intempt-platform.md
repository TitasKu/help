Intempt Platform is the industry’s first full-featured “no-code” CDXP Customer Data and Experience platform. It provides a set of unified data, segmentation, and experience serving technology with APIs, SDKs, and protocols that enable businesses to launch their own Intempt-based User data aggregation and to serve personalized experiences to any endpoint.

Our Server Side SDK (currently Node.JS) and Client SDKs (now Web JS and iOS) together enable fast and painless integration into any app, without requiring in-house big data engineering or personalization expertise. With Intempt, you can focus on your business and leave the CDP and CDXP bits to us.
